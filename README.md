# 🔍 Filter Optimization Dashboard

This project is a React-based Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard that mimics filter behavior similar to platforms like Amazon. It efficiently handles large datasets, allows users to filter based on multiple attributes (`mod350`, `mod8000`, `mod20002`), and supports bookmarking of rows. Each filter is dynamically updated based on current selections.
